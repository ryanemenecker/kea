Future implementations
short term...
1. Add in more complicated optimization including the following:
    1a) mRNA splice sites for various organisms (avoiding cryptic and known splice sites)
    1b) reducing mRNA secondary structure
    1c) avoiding polyA regions that could result in problems of synthesizability and premature polyA signals)
    1d) 
2. Add in weighting for codon pairs.
3. add more organisms
4. implement dnahive (see https://dnahive.fda.gov/dna.cgi?cmd=codon_usage&id=537&mode=cocoputs)
5. Add in ability to avoid restriction sites
6. Add in ability to avoid repetetive regions. 
7. Add in ability to add in restriction sites either in the sequence or at the ends. 

Long term...
1. Implement more versatile framework for optimization to make implementation of future features more streamlined
2. ML-based functionaltiy that is trained on CDS for many different organisms
3. Fine tune the network form 1 on individual organisms.
