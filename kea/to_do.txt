Future implementations
short term...
1. Add in weighting for codon pairs.
2. add more organisms
3. implement dnahive (see https://dnahive.fda.gov/dna.cgi?cmd=codon_usage&id=537&mode=cocoputs)
4. Add in ability to avoid restriction sites
5. Add in ability to avoid repetetive regions. 

Long term...
1. ML-based functionaltiy that is trained on CDS for many different organisms
2. Fine tune the network form 1 on individual organisms.
